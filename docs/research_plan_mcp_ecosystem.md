# Research Plan: MCP (Model Context Protocol) Ecosystem Analysis

## Objectives
- Understand the MCP ecosystem and how MCPs work
- Collect comprehensive information about 50+ commonly used MCPs
- Create structured data suitable for navigation website development
- Develop logical categorization system for MCP organization

## Key Questions
1. What are MCPs and how do they work technically?
2. What is the current state and adoption of the MCP ecosystem?
3. Where are the main repositories and sources for MCPs?
4. What are the most popular and well-maintained MCPs available?
5. How should MCPs be categorized for user navigation?
6. What data structure would be most suitable for website development?

## Expected Deliverables
- Comprehensive MCP ecosystem overview report
- Structured JSON database of 50+ MCPs with detailed information
- Categorization system for MCP organization
- Data collection methodology documentation
- Source tracking and verification documentation

## Workflow Selection
- Primary focus: Search
- Justification: This task requires extensive information gathering from multiple sources, discovery of repositories, and compilation of detailed data about numerous MCPs

## Research Strategy
1. **Phase 1: Baseline Understanding**
   - Research MCP fundamentals and technical specifications
   - Identify official sources and documentation
   - Understand ecosystem structure

2. **Phase 2: Source Discovery**
   - Find official MCP repositories and directories
   - Identify community sources and collections
   - Locate popular MCP implementations

3. **Phase 3: Systematic Collection**
   - Research individual MCPs systematically
   - Collect detailed metadata for each MCP
   - Verify information accuracy and currency

4. **Phase 4: Organization & Structure**
   - Develop categorization system
   - Structure data in JSON format
   - Validate completeness and quality

## Success Criteria
- Minimum 50 well-documented MCPs collected
- Complete technical understanding of MCP ecosystem
- Usable JSON structure for website development
- Logical categorization system
- High-quality, verified source documentation
